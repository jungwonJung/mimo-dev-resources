### Getting Started Notes
- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag, so you don't have to worry about that.
